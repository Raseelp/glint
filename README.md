Glint is a social networking app designed to help long-distance friends, family, and loved ones stay connected by sharing moments through photos. The app offers a unique and fun way to engage with your loved ones daily, making the distance feel shorter and the bond stronger.

Key Features:
Create and Join Groups: Users can create private groups with their loved ones or join existing groups to share their daily life.


Theme-Based Photo Sharing: Each day, group members can upload photos based on a theme selected by someone in the group. Themes rotate on a set schedule, giving everyone a chance to set a theme and share photos based on it.


Glint Feature: A special feature that allows one user per day to activate a timer, giving the rest of the group two minutes to upload a photo. This feature is gamified, awarding points based on participation, making it an engaging experience.


Memory Section: Users can relive their memories by viewing photos they've shared in the past. These memories can be sorted by group or date, helping you look back on the moments you've created.


User-Friendly Design: With an intuitive interface, Glint makes it easy to share moments, set themes, and participate in fun daily challenges with your loved ones.
Whether you're separated by miles or just a few blocks away, Glint brings people closer together by turning ordinary moments into meaningful memories.
